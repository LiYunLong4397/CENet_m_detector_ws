# M-Detector with CENet Semantic Segmentation

**A Real-time LiDAR-based Dynamic Object Detection System Enhanced with Semantic Segmentation**

## Overview

This project integrates **M-Detector** (multi-frame occlusion-based dynamic object detection) with **CENet** (lightweight semantic segmentation network) to improve dynamic object detection accuracy in autonomous driving scenarios. 

### Key Features

- ✅ **Multi-frame occlusion analysis** for robust dynamic detection
- ✅ **Semantic-guided detection** with adaptive thresholds
- ✅ **Lightweight CENet** for real-time semantic segmentation
- ✅ **Semantic-assisted clustering** for better object grouping
- ✅ **ROS integration** for easy deployment
- ✅ **Real-time performance** suitable for autonomous driving
